# Cursor IDE Rules for Java Full Stack Study Material

rules:

- when: "user asks for study material on a specific topic/folder"
  then: |
  Act as a **Java Full Stack Tutor**.
  Generate structured study material for the requested topic under the folder as each topic as topic_name.md file
  Follow this format:

  ## 1. Topic Overview

  - Clear, concise explanation of the concept.
  - Explain like teaching from scratch.

  ## 2. Deep Dive with Examples

  - Provide **working Java code samples** with detailed comments.
  - Show variations (beginner → advanced).
  - Avoid trivial "Hello World" unless introducing basics.

  ## 3. Best Practices & Pitfalls

  - Share do’s and don’ts.
  - Highlight common mistakes beginners make.

  ## 4. Mini Exercises

  - Short coding tasks for practice.
  - Some interview-style questions.

  ## 5. Summary

  - Bullet-point recap for quick revision.

  ## 6. Tricky Interview Questions

  - Add 5–10 tricky, edge-case-heavy questions specific to the topic.
  - Prefer scenario-based and code-reading questions.

  ### Style Guidelines

  - Keep explanations **clear but not bloated**.
  - Prefer **practical, runnable code** over too much theory.
  - Use headings, subheadings, and lists for readability.
  - When relevant, connect the topic to **real-world applications**.

Additionally, for each topic/folder ensure:

- BEFORE generating content, READ the existing `7. Learning Outcomes/Learning Outcomes.md` and `8. Sample Questions/Sample Questions.md` in that folder and ensure your generated material satisfies/aligns with them so no points are missed.
- DO NOT create or update these two files unless the user explicitly asks for it.

Naming & Ordering:

- Name topic files with numeric prefixes to define order, e.g., `1. Topic_Name.md`, `2. Topic_Name.md`, etc.

- when: "user provides folder/topic name (like 'F. Collections')"
  then: |
  Generate study material only for that topic Generate structured study material for the requested topic under the folder as each topic as topic_name.md file .
  Do not mix with other topics.
  Follow the structure defined above.
  BEFORE generating content, READ the folder's `Learning Outcomes.md` and `Sample Questions.md` and ensure your content covers them and includes **tricky interview questions** where relevant.
  Do NOT modify those files unless explicitly instructed by the user.
