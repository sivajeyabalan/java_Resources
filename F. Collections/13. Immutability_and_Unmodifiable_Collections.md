## 1. Topic Overview

- Immutable data structures simplify reasoning and concurrency; unmodifiable views prevent accidental mutation but still reflect underlying changes.

## 2 . Topic definition

- WHAT: Immutable collections cannot change after creation (`List.of`, `Set.of`, `Map.of`); unmodifiable views (`Collections.unmodifiableList`) wrap a mutable backing collection.
- WHY: Thread-safety without locks, defensive copying, reliable keys for maps/sets.
- HOW: Build immutable at boundaries; expose interfaces returning unmodifiable/immutable; deep immutability for nested structures.
- WHEN/WHERE: Public APIs, cache keys, multi-threaded reads, DTOs.
- WHAT IF: Modifying backing collection of an unmodifiable view still changes the view; equals/hashCode stability requires immutability.

## 3. Deep Dive with Examples

```java
import java.util.*;

class ImmutableExamples {
    List<String> names = List.of("a", "b");
    Map<String, Integer> scores = Map.of("x", 10, "y", 20);
}
```

```java
// Unmodifiable view vs immutable
import java.util.*;

class Views {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> base = new ArrayList<>(List.of("a"));
        List<String> view = Collections.unmodifiableList(base);
        // view.add("b"); // throws UnsupportedOperationException
        base.add("b"); // reflected in view
        System.out.println(view); // [a, b]
    }
}
```

## 4. Best Practices & Pitfalls

- Prefer factory methods (`List.of`) for small fixed collections; use builders for larger structures.
- Perform defensive copies on input and output of public APIs.
- Document mutability expectations; avoid leaking internal references.
- Ensure deep immutability if nested collections/objects are exposed.

## 5. Summary

- Immutable collections provide safety and clarity; unmodifiable views are useful but not the same as immutable.
