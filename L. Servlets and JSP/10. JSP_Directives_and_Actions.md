## 1. Topic Overview

Directives configure the JSP page and compilation; actions are XML-like tags that perform dynamic operations (including standard actions like `jsp:include`, `jsp:forward`, `jsp:useBean`).

## 2 . Topic definition

- **Page directive**: `<%@ page ... %>` controls contentType, import, isELIgnored, etc.
- **Include directive**: `<%@ include file="..." %>` static include at translation time.
- **Taglib directive**: `<%@ taglib prefix="c" uri="..." %>` registers tag libraries.
- **Standard actions**: `<jsp:include>`, `<jsp:forward>`, `<jsp:useBean>`, `<jsp:setProperty>`, `<jsp:getProperty>`.

## 3. Deep Dive with Examples

```jsp
<%@ page contentType="text/html;charset=UTF-8" import="java.time.*" %>
<%@ include file="/WEB-INF/fragments/header.jsp" %>
<jsp:include page="/time.jsp" />
<jsp:forward page="/home.jsp" />
```

```jsp
<jsp:useBean id="user" class="com.example.User" scope="request" />
<jsp:setProperty name="user" property="name" value="${param.n}"/>
Hello ${user.name}
```

## 4. Best Practices & Pitfalls

- Prefer `<jsp:include>` for dynamic inclusion; use include directive for static fragments.
- Avoid `jsp:useBean` in modern apps; prefer setting attributes in controllers.
- Keep taglib URIs correct for JSTL versions.

## 5. Summary

- Directives configure; actions execute tasks at request time.

## 6. Tricky Interview Questions

1) When would a static include be preferred over a dynamic include and why?
2) What are drawbacks of `jsp:useBean` vs MVC with controller-set attributes?
