## 1. Topic Overview

Robust MVC on the server uses Servlets as controllers, JSP as views with EL/JSTL, and services/DAOs as the model. Clear boundaries keep code readable, testable, and secure.

## 2 . Topic definition

- **Controller**: Orchestrates flow, validates, selects view, sets scoped attributes.
- **View**: JSP with EL/JSTL only; no business logic.
- **Model**: POJOs + service/DAO layers containing business rules and persistence.

## 3. Deep Dive with Examples

```java
// Controller selects view model + view
req.setAttribute("errors", validationErrors);
if (!validationErrors.isEmpty()) {
  req.getRequestDispatcher("/WEB-INF/views/form.jsp").forward(req, resp);
  return;
}
service.save(cmd);
resp.sendRedirect(req.getContextPath()+"/list"); // PRG
```

```jsp
<!-- View renders with EL/JSTL -->
<c:if test="${not empty errors}">
  <ul><c:forEach var="e" items="${errors}"><li>${e}</li></c:forEach></ul>
</c:if>
```

## 4. Best Practices & Pitfalls

- Validate in controller/service; present errors in JSP; use PRG.
- Never put SQL or HTTP calls in JSPs.
- Use DTOs/command objects for form binding.
- Centralize layouts with includes; keep JSPs small.
- Pitfall: Fat controllers; extract services.

## 5. Summary

- Strict MVC boundaries; PRG; EL/JSTL-only views.

## 6. Tricky Interview Questions

1) How to design validation to avoid duplication across controllers and views?
2) When do you introduce a view model vs exposing entities directly?
