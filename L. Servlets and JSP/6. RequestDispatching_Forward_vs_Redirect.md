## 1. Topic Overview

Forwarding and redirecting are two ways to continue processing after a servlet finishes work. Forward is server-side handoff within the same request; redirect is a client round-trip to a new URL.

## 2 . Topic definition

- **Forward**: `RequestDispatcher.forward(req, resp)` keeps the same request/response; attributes survive; URL in browser stays the same.
- **Include**: `dispatcher.include(req, resp)` merges output of another resource.
- **Redirect**: `resp.sendRedirect(url)` sends 302/303 to client; new request; request attributes lost.
- **PRG**: Post/Redirect/Get pattern avoids duplicate form submissions.

## 3. Deep Dive with Examples

```java
// Forward example
req.setAttribute("user", user);
req.getRequestDispatcher("/WEB-INF/views/profile.jsp").forward(req, resp);

// Redirect example (PRG)
resp.sendRedirect(req.getContextPath() + "/products?created=1");
```

## 4. Best Practices & Pitfalls

- Use forward to render views; use redirect after state-changing POSTs (PRG).
- Preserve flash messages across redirect using session or a flash scope.
- Pitfall: Relying on request attributes after redirectâ€”they will be lost.

## 5. Summary

- Forward: same request, server-internal. Redirect: new request, client round-trip.

## 6. Tricky Interview Questions

1) Would you use redirect or forward after a successful form POST? Why?
2) How do you pass success/error messages across a redirect safely?
