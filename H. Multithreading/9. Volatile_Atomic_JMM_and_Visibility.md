## 1. Topic Overview

- The Java Memory Model (JMM) defines how threads interact through memory. `volatile`, atomic classes, and `final` field semantics ensure visibility and ordering.

## 2 . Topic definition

- WHAT: `volatile` ensures visibility (writes by one thread are seen by others) and establishes happens-before; atomic classes provide lock-free atomic operations.
- WHY: Without visibility guarantees, threads may read stale values due to caches/reordering.
- HOW: Mark shared, mutable, read-often flags as `volatile`; use `AtomicInteger`, `AtomicReference`, `LongAdder`, etc., for atomic updates.
- WHEN/WHERE: Use `volatile` for simple flags or one-writer/many-reader patterns; use atomics for counters/accumulators; use locks for compound invariants.
- WHAT IF: Using `volatile` for compound actions (check-then-act) breaks atomicity; double-checked locking requires `volatile`.

## 3. Deep Dive with Examples

```java
public class VolatileFlag {
    private volatile boolean running = true;

    public void stop() {
        running = false; // visible to reader thread
    }

    public void runLoop() {
        while (running) {
            // do work
        }
    }
}
```

```java
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;

public class AtomicCounter {
    private final AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger();

    public int incrementAndGet() {
        return count.incrementAndGet(); // atomic
    }

    public int addIfLessThan(int delta, int limit) {
        while (true) {
            int current = count.get();
            if (current >= limit) return current;
            int next = current + delta;
            if (count.compareAndSet(current, next)) {
                return next;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

```java
public class DoubleCheckedSingleton {
    private static volatile DoubleCheckedSingleton instance;

    private DoubleCheckedSingleton() {}

    public static DoubleCheckedSingleton getInstance() {
        DoubleCheckedSingleton result = instance;
        if (result == null) {
            synchronized (DoubleCheckedSingleton.class) {
                result = instance;
                if (result == null) {
                    result = new DoubleCheckedSingleton();
                    instance = result;
                }
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

## 4. Best Practices & Pitfalls

- Use `volatile` for simple state flags or publication, not for invariants spanning multiple fields.
- Prefer atomic classes for counters and CAS-based updates; `LongAdder` for high contention.
- Understand happens-before: write to `volatile` happens-before subsequent reads.
- Do not assume `volatile` guarantees atomic compound actions.
- Safely publish immutable objects with `final` fields; avoid escaping `this` during construction.

## 5. Summary

- JMM governs visibility/ordering. `volatile` gives visibility, atomics give lock-free atomicity, locks protect invariants.

## 6. Tricky Interview Questions

1. What guarantees does `volatile` provide? What does it not provide?
2. Why is `volatile` required for double-checked locking? Explain reordering.
3. Compare `AtomicInteger` vs `synchronized` for counters under contention.
4. When to prefer `LongAdder` over `AtomicLong`?
5. How does safe publication work? Role of `final` fields and constructors.
6. Show a broken pattern that `volatile` cannot fix (check-then-act).
