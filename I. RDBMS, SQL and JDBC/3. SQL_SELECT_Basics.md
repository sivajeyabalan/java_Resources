## 1. Topic Overview

The SQL SELECT statement retrieves data from one or more tables. It supports projection (choosing columns), selection (filtering rows), joining tables, aggregation, sorting, and pagination. Mastering SELECT is the foundation of querying relational databases.

## 2 . Topic definition

- **What**: A declarative query for reading data: `SELECT ... FROM ...` with optional `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `ORDER BY`.
- **Why**: Extract precisely the data you need efficiently and consistently.
- **How**: The optimizer builds an execution plan (index scans, joins) to return results.
- **When/Where**: Everywhere you read data: reports, APIs, analytics, validations.
- **What If**: Missing predicates cause full scans; wrong joins produce cartesian products; implicit conversions break indexes.

Common clauses (logical order of execution)
1. FROM (and JOIN)
2. WHERE
3. GROUP BY
4. HAVING
5. SELECT (projection)
6. DISTINCT
7. ORDER BY

## 3. Deep Dive with Examples

```sql
-- Sample schema
CREATE TABLE dept (
  dept_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
  name    VARCHAR2(50)
);
CREATE TABLE emp (
  emp_id   NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
  ename    VARCHAR2(50) NOT NULL,
  sal      NUMBER(10,2),
  dept_id  NUMBER REFERENCES dept(dept_id)
);

INSERT INTO dept VALUES (10, 'Sales');
INSERT INTO dept VALUES (20, 'Eng');
INSERT INTO emp VALUES (7369, 'SMITH', 800, 20);
INSERT INTO emp VALUES (7499, 'ALLEN', 1600, 10);

-- Projection
SELECT emp_id, ename FROM emp;

-- Aliases and expressions
SELECT ename AS name, sal * 12 AS annual_salary FROM emp;

-- DISTINCT
SELECT DISTINCT dept_id FROM emp;

-- Filtering (selection)
SELECT * FROM emp WHERE sal > 1000;

-- BETWEEN / IN / LIKE / IS NULL
SELECT * FROM emp WHERE sal BETWEEN 1000 AND 2000;
SELECT * FROM emp WHERE dept_id IN (10, 30);
SELECT * FROM emp WHERE ename LIKE 'S%';
SELECT * FROM emp WHERE sal IS NULL;

-- ORDER BY (ASC default, DESC)
SELECT emp_id, ename, sal FROM emp ORDER BY sal DESC, ename ASC;

-- Simple inner join
SELECT e.ename, d.name AS dept
FROM emp e JOIN dept d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;

-- Avoid cartesian product (missing join condition)
-- SELECT * FROM emp e, dept d; -- Wrong unless intentional CROSS JOIN

-- Aggregation and grouping
SELECT dept_id, COUNT(*) AS cnt, AVG(sal) AS avg_sal
FROM emp
GROUP BY dept_id
HAVING AVG(sal) > 1000
ORDER BY avg_sal DESC;

-- Wildcard * returns all columns (use sparingly)
SELECT * FROM emp;
```

## 4. Best Practices & Pitfalls

- Do: select only needed columns; reduce network and I/O.
- Do: use meaningful aliases; improve readability.
- Do: ensure join predicates are correct and selective.
- Don't: rely on implicit conversions; cast explicitly when needed.
- Don't: use SELECT * in production queries.
- Pitfalls: missing join conditions (cartesian), ambiguous column names, nondeterministic ORDER BY without explicit columns.

## 5. Summary

- SELECT retrieves data using projection, selection, joins, and aggregation.
- Clause order matters; know logical vs syntactic order.
- Use DISTINCT, ORDER BY, and predicates judiciously for correctness and performance.

## 6. Tricky Interview Questions

1. What is the logical order of SELECT clause evaluation?
2. How does DISTINCT interact with ORDER BY and GROUP BY?
3. Explain a scenario that accidentally creates a cartesian product and how to fix it.
4. Why can implicit type conversions harm performance? Give an example.
5. When would you avoid SELECT * and why?
