## 1. Topic Overview

- Scenario-based guide to common Spring Boot interview questions: configuration, failures, performance, and production readiness.

## 2 . Topic definition

- WHAT: Troubleshooting patterns and best practices for Boot apps.
- WHY: Interviews test practical debugging and architecture choices, not just APIs.
- HOW: Recognize symptoms, isolate layers, use Actuator/logs, and fix root causes.
- WHEN/WHERE: During design reviews and incident triage.

## 3. Deep Dive with Examples

- Configuration not applied
  - Check active profiles, property names, relaxed binding, `@ConfigurationProperties` prefix/classpath.
- 404 vs 401 vs 403
  - Controller mappings vs security matchers; enable debug logs for `org.springframework.security`.
- Slow endpoints
  - Use `@Timed` metrics, analyze DB queries (logging/insight), thread pools saturation, blocking calls.
- Transaction not working
  - Self-invocation, wrong proxy mode, missing `@EnableTransactionManagement`, checked exceptions.
- Memory/GC issues
  - Heap dumps, actuator `/heapdump` (secure!), analyze allocations; reduce object churn, stream large responses.
- Startup failures
  - Autoconfiguration report (`--debug`), missing beans, circular deps, port conflicts.

## 4. Best Practices & Pitfalls

- Externalize configuration; use profiles and config servers when needed.
- Health and readiness probes; structured logging and correlation IDs.
- Defensive timeouts on HTTP/DB clients; circuit breakers when appropriate.

## 5. Summary

- Be ready to diagnose config, security, performance, and transaction issues using Boot’s tooling and patterns.

## 6. Tricky Interview Questions

1. How do you debug “`@Transactional` not working” in a Boot app?
2. How do you identify and fix a thread pool exhaustion issue in production?
