## 1. Topic Overview

- Practical troubleshooting for Spring apps: configuration, DI/proxy issues, transactions, performance, and startup failures.

## 2 . Topic definition

- WHAT: Symptom-driven guide for common Spring problems and their fixes.
- WHY: Interviews emphasize debugging skills and real-world experience.
- HOW: Use logs, condition evaluation report, Actuator, and targeted checks to isolate issues.

## 3. Deep Dive with Examples

Configuration issues:
- Properties not applied: wrong prefix, profile not active, missing `@ConfigurationProperties` scan.
- Bean not created: missing `@Component/@Configuration`, package scanning path.

DI/proxy issues:
- Circular dependency: refactor to ports/events; use setter injection where appropriate.
- `@Transactional` not effective: self-invocation, final methods, wrong proxy mode.

Web/security issues:
- 403 vs 401: missing auth vs insufficient authority; inspect security filter chain logs.
- CORS errors: configure `CorsConfigurationSource` or `@CrossOrigin`.

Data/transactions:
- LazyInitializationException: access outside transaction; fetch eagerly per use case or extend transaction.
- Deadlocks/timeouts: narrow transaction scope, adjust isolation, add retries.

Performance:
- N+1 queries: use fetch joins/graphs/batch; see Hibernate section.
- Thread pool exhaustion: tune pools, identify blocking operations.

Startup failures:
- `NoSuchBeanDefinition`: missing bean or ambiguous candidates; add qualifiers.
- Port in use: change `server.port`.

## 4. Best Practices & Pitfalls

- Enable `--debug` for auto-config report; use condition evaluation report in logs.
- Add request/trace IDs to logs; log at boundaries and on errors.
- Prefer health/readiness endpoints and metrics for live diagnostics.

## 5. Summary

- Troubleshooting is systematic: identify the layer, inspect logs/metrics, validate assumptions, and fix root causes.

## 6. Tricky Interview Questions

1. Walk through debugging a `LazyInitializationException` in a controller.
2. How to identify and remediate thread pool exhaustion in a Boot app?
