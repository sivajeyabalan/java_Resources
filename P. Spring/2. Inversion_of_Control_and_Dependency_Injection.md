## 1. Topic Overview

Inversion of Control (IoC) delegates object creation and wiring to a container. Dependency Injection (DI) is how IoC is realized (constructor, setter, field).

## 2 . Topic definition

- **IoC**: Framework controls object lifecycle and dependencies.
- **DI**: Providing required dependencies to a class from outside.
- **Types**: Constructor, setter, and field injection (discouraged).

## 3. Deep Dive with Examples

Constructor injection:
```java
@Component
class OrderService {
  private final PaymentGateway gateway;
  OrderService(PaymentGateway gateway) { this.gateway = gateway; }
}
@Component class PaymentGateway {}
```

Setter injection:
```java
@Component
class EmailSender {
  private MailClient client;
  @Autowired void setClient(MailClient client){ this.client = client; }
}
```

Qualifiers and multiple beans:
```java
interface Notifier {}
@Component("email") class EmailNotifier implements Notifier {}
@Component("sms") class SmsNotifier implements Notifier {}
@Component class AlertService { AlertService(@Qualifier("sms") Notifier n){} }
```

## 4. Best Practices & Pitfalls

- Prefer constructor injection for immutability and testability.
- Avoid field injection; harder to test and mock.
- Pitfall: Cyclic dependencies â€” redesign or use setter injection carefully.

## 5. Summary

- IoC inverts control to the container; DI provides dependencies via constructors/setters.
