## 1. Topic Overview

XPath selects nodes in XML using path expressions and predicates. XQuery is a more general query language for XML data with FLWOR expressions.

## 2 . Topic definition

- **XPath**: Path syntax (`/a/b`, `//item[@id='1']`).
- **Predicates**: Filters inside `[]`.
- **XQuery**: Functional query language with `for-let-where-order-return`.

## 3. Deep Dive with Examples

XPath samples:
- `/invoice/customer`
- `//line[item='Pen']`
- `//line[qty > 5]`

XQuery FLWOR:
```xquery
for $l in /invoice/lines/line
where $l/qty > 5
order by $l/item
return <expensive>{$l/item/text()}</expensive>
```

Java XPath API:
```java
XPath xp = XPathFactory.newInstance().newXPath();
String name = (String) xp.evaluate("/invoice/customer", doc, XPathConstants.STRING);
```

## 4. Best Practices & Pitfalls

- Keep expressions readable; reuse common paths.
- Be careful with `//` (descendant-or-self); it may be expensive.
- Validate input before injecting into XPath to avoid injection-like issues.

## 5. Summary

- XPath selects nodes; XQuery performs advanced querying and transformation.
